# Research Question

Asexual Whiptail hybrids of sexually reproducing Whiptail lizards
present with decreased endurance as compared to their parents. Is thier
decreased endurance due to incompatibility between the parental nuclear
mitochondrial DNA?

# Knowledge Gap

Does there exist a difference in the DNA makeup of the nuclear mitochondrial DNA
between the sexually reproducing parents. If there is a difference, is there
incompatability causing the difference in endurance.


# Predictions

There is a difference in the DNA between the DNA in the parent species of
Whiptail lizards. This difference causes a change in the translation of the DNA
into the protein. The change in the protein causes a decrease in endurance of
the asexual hybrids.
